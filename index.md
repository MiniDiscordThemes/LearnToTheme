- *If you just want to set a colour scheme with a background image, and don't have the time or energy to read this page, use [bdeditor.dev](https://bdeditor.dev/).*
- *If you would like to theme and would like to jump right in, see [my theme template](https://github.com/Saltssaumure/template-discord-theme).*

### Pre-requisites
Since the guide is aimed at beginners, there is very little assumed knowledge. However, you will need to know:
- how to use your computer,
- a little about HTML, and
- nothing about CSS or GitHub or npm.

There are detailed instructions for the usage of the main three desktop client mods:
- [![icon][bd] BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/),
- [![icon][rp] Replugged](https://replugged.dev/),
- [![icon][vc] Vencord](https://vencord.dev).

However, the general principles apply to most client mods.
