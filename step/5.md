## Step 5: Theme development tools
I will probably continue writing more, but here's the highlights for now:
- [Sass/SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/), and tools for using it:
  - Gibbu's [create-bd-theme](https://github.com/Gibbu/create-bd-theme) tool.
  - My personalised version of Gibbu's tool, no CLI though: https://github.com/Saltssaumure/bd-scss
  - QuickSCSS, for writing custom/quick CSS in SCSS, and syncing across multiple client mods.
- [My theme template](https://github.com/Saltssaumure/template-discord-theme), which includes pretty much everything discussed here.
- [ClassUpdate](https://github.com/Saltssaumure/ClassUpdate) - a tool for automatically updating class names in themes.

### Sass/SCSS
BetterDiscord and Vencord require an external tool to compile Sass/SCSS to CSS, but Replugged has it built-in.
