## Step 2: Writing Custom CSS and Themes

If you know some CSS, this is the place to start.

### In this page
- [2.1: Developer settings](#21-developer-settings)
- [2.2: Writing Custom / Quick CSS](#22-writing-custom--quick-css)
- [2.3: Writing a theme](#23-writing-a-theme)

### 2.1: Developer settings
Before beginning, DevTools is a requirement to find class names and view Discord's default styles for those classes. Open DevTools with `Ctrl + Shift + I` (windows/linux) / `Cmd + Opt + I` (mac).

#### ![icon][bd] BetterDiscord
1. Open `Settings` > `BetterDiscord` > `Settings` > `Developer Settings`.
2. Enable the following: 
   - DevTools (mandatory)
   - Debugger Hotkey (convenient for quickly checking hover-only styles)
   - Inspect Element Hotkey (convenient shortcut)
   - Stop DevTools Warning (makes Console tab in devtools actually readable)

#### ![icon][rp] Replugged and ![icon][vc] Vencord
No extra steps needed, DevTools is enabled by default.

### 2.2: Writing Custom / Quick CSS
1. With the ![inspect element tool][inspectelements] Inspect Element tool (top left corner of DevTools), click on an area that you want to style.
   - Clicking may not always give the exact right element, you may need to go up or down some levels in the document viewer panel.  
![document viewer panel][documentviewer].
1. Copy the class name and write your styles for it in Custom / Quick CSS. Remember to save (and/or turn on Live Update) to see your changes.  

#### Example
```css
/* Turns the user panel green */
.container_ca50b9 {
    background: green;
}
```
![The user panel with a green background][greenuserpanel]

#### Notes
- The in-app editor can be sluggish on less powerful devices, especially with `Live CSS` / `Automatically Apply Quick CSS` enabled. Try an external editor (eg. Notepad++, Nano, VSCode) if you experience issues.

### 2.3: Writing a theme
Custom / Quick CSS can quickly get cluttered and hard to navigate, so it's better to write a theme in a separate file:

#### ![icon][bd] BetterDiscord and ![icon][vc] Vencord
This is covered by the [BetterDiscord themes guide](https://docs.betterdiscord.app/themes/introduction/quick-start). Here's a summary:

1. Go to the `themes` folder: `Settings` > `Themes` > `Open Theme Folder`.
2. Make a file with name ending in `.theme.css`, eg. `MyTheme.theme.css`.
3. Start the contents with the theme meta:
```css
/**
 * @name My Theme
 * @author My Name
 * @description This is my theme. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
 * @version 1.0
 */
```
4. Add your CSS rules after the meta.

##### Notes
- See the BetterDiscord docs for the [full list of meta fields](https://docs.betterdiscord.app/developers/addons/#meta).
- The meta is allowed to contain other unrecognised fields, eg. `@license`, which will be simply ignored by the mod.

#### ![icon][rp] Replugged
1. Go to the `themes` folder: `Settings` > `Themes` > `Open Themes Folder`.
2. Make a folder with the name of your theme, eg. `MyTheme`.
3. In that folder, make:
    1. A file named `manifest.json` with the theme manifest:  
    ```json
    {
        "id": "com.example.mytheme",
        "name": "My Theme",
        "author": {
            "name": "My Name"
        },
        "description": "This is my theme. There are many like it, but this one is mine.",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "license": "MIT",
        "type": "replugged-theme"
    }
    ```
    2. A file named `main.css` with your CSS rules.

##### Notes
- See the Replugged docs for the [full list of manifest keys](https://guide.replugged.dev/docs/manifest).
- Use [choosealicense.com](https://choosealicense.com/) to find a license that suits your needs. The MIT license is common for open source projects, but you can use any license you like.
