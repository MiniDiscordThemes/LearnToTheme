## About this guide

**This is a step-by-step guide to creating Discord themes.**

This guide assumes that you know:
- how to use your computer,
- a little about HTML, and
- nothing about CSS or GitHub or npm.

I am writing this guide with the main three client mods in mind:
- [![icon][bd] BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/),
- [![icon][rp] Replugged](https://replugged.dev/),
- [![icon][vc] Vencord](https://vencord.dev).

However, the general principles apply to most desktop client mods.
